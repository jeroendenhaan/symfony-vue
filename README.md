# symfony-vue

Simple playground/sandbox setup for containerized Symfony/PHP/mySQL setup, with persistent volumes for Symfony code and mySQL database(s).

## Installation
From the project's root directory:
```
cd symfony
```
Create file .env.local and put your environment and secret in it:
```
# Overwrite values in Symfony's .env using global .env in root (or fallback for Composer install)
APP_ENV=dev
APP_SECRET=your_secret_here
```
Then install all dependencies:
```
composer install
npm install
npm run dev
cd ..
```
Copy (and edit) sample environment:
```
cp .env.sample .env
```
Run the Docker Compose cluster (or use './up.sh' in root directory):
```
docker compose up --build
```
In container 'php' run:
```
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
That'll create a MySQL table named 'person' and fill it with some test data.
